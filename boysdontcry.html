              <p>Anthony is a whangai boy who lives with his foster parents after the death of his mother and father. Despite the three years passed, Anthony now in year six remains confused and hurt as his emotions dwell within him like a snake coiled in a basket. He was eventually expelled from primary school because it was shameful to not help other mischief no-gooders burn school property. He was moved to a school for Maori kura and his teachers were Maori women who were kind but firm with him. Eventually succumbing to his drowning ocean of emotions which clash with the infuence of these women, will Anthony find a way to rid himself of the idea of shameful acts or will he just keep burning?
