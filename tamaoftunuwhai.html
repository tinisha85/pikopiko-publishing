           <h2>Tama o Tunuwhai</h2>
              <br>
              <p>In a time before the northland warring tribes, Tama of Tunuwhai lived in peace and harmony amongst his people of the Kaitanga tribe. Part of upholding a peace agreement with the neighbouring tribes of northland, Tama would trade food and clothing materials for timbers and building supplies for his tribe members. Protection and mutual support among the neighbouring tribes was the clockwork of intertribal relations until Rata the merciless chief of Okutoru set his greed-driven sights on the lands of Tunuwhai. Will Tama be able to protect his whanau from an incoming invasion?</p>
